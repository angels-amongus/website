  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
  Even during a global pandemic like COVID-19, the impact on humanity is far from uniform. Consider this: if you’re earning a salary during the lockdown, your biggest worry is staying indoors and staying uninfected. For many other people, it’s a different juggling act. Many people earn from daily work, especially in the informal economy, and the lockdown is effectively a death sentence. They have to think about not getting infected while fighting off hunger pangs and drowning in the pain of not being able to fend for a family that is dependent on them.

<br/><br/>‘Angels Among Us’ is a tool that gives you the ability to do something about it. If you’re on a salary or on a relatively comfortable financial level this period, consider distributing a small percentage of your income (ideally on a monthly or weekly basis) to people who are in need of support.

<br/><br/>Angels Among Us does not take a commission on the money you send. As a matter of fact, your money does not even go through Angels Among Us. The role of the tool is simple: to match public-spirited visitors (like you) with people seeking help, and the tool does it in a programmatically non-deterministic way (that is, Angels Among Us randomly sends you three names of people to help. That way, everyone has a fair chance to be helped, not influenced by the website at all!)
  </p>
  <h1>How can I help?</h1>
  <p>On the homepage, click the 'Be an angel' button to see a randomly-generated list of three people who need help from you. Please send the same amount of money to all of them. This is a great way to ensure that as many people as possible are uniformly reached by kind people like you.</p>
  <h1>I need help</h1>
  <p>Click the 'I need help' button on the homepage and let people know just what you need

This is a good faith project: it works because honest people want to help honest people in need.

If your financial needs have been met, send me an email here so I can take out your name. This is important so other people in need are likelier to be helped.</p>
<h1>I want to volunteer!</h1>
<p>If you're a dev looking to add features to make this project better, shoot me an email here. If you want to lend your support as a comms expert to handle social media and/other ways of reaching out to people who need help and donors alike, also send me an email!</p>
