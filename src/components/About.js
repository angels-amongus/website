            <h2>'Angels among us' is a simple tool (heavily inspired by <a href="https://leveler.info">Leveler)</a> for people looking for ways to share some of their income with people who are in dire economic straits because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</h2>
            <h2>It is a simple database of people who need help, randomly delivered to you ten at a time. You can then copy their account details and make a contribution to their well-being.</h2>
            <h2>None of your payments pass through me in any form. You are helping these distressed people directly, without my having to play a middleman's role. I make no profit from this, and I do not collect commissions. I earn nothing from this.</h2>
            <br/>
            <h1>How do I help?</h1>
            <h2>On the homepage, click the 'Be an angel' button to see a randomly-generated list of 10 people who need help from you. Please send the same amount of money to all of them. This is a great way to ensure that as many people as possible are uniformly reached by kind people like you.</h2>
            <br/>
            <h1>I need help</h1>
            <h2>Click the 'I need help' button on the homepage and let people know just what you need</h2>
            <h2>This is a good faith project: it works because honest people want to help honest people in need.</h2>
            <h2>If your financial needs have been met, send me an email <a href="mailto:thevunderkind@gmail.com">here</a> so I can take out your name. This is important so other people in need are likelier to be helped.</h2>

            <h2>If you're a dev looking to add features to make this project better, shoot me an email <a href="mailto:thevunderkind@gmail.com">here</a>. If you want to lend your support as a comms expert to handle social media and/other ways of reaching out to people who need help and donors alike, also send me an email!</h2>
